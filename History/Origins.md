# Origins

Long before the world of Arathia was inhabited by humans, it was home to powerful beasts, magical creatures, and elemental forces. Among these beings was a mysterious entity known as the First Mage, who possessed the power to manipulate the very fabric of reality itself.

For countless eons, the First Mage roamed the vast expanse of Arathia, honing its skills and exploring the limits of its abilities. It created towering mountains and deep oceans, conjured storms and blizzards, and breathed life into the countless creatures that now populated the land.

But despite its incredible power, the First Mage was lonely. It yearned for someone to share its vast knowledge and power with, someone who could help it shape the world in even more wondrous ways.

And so, the First Mage created humans, imbuing them with a spark of magic that would allow them to channel the elemental forces of Arathia. With this newfound power, humans were able to build great cities and civilizations, harness the power of the elements for their own purposes, and explore the mysteries of the world around them.

But as time passed, some humans grew greedy and sought to wield magic for their own selfish gain. They created dark rituals and sacrificed innocent creatures in order to gain even more power, turning their backs on the natural order of the world.

Seeing this, the First Mage was filled with anger and sadness. It had hoped that humans would use their magic to create beauty and wonder, but instead, they had chosen to use it for destruction and evil.

And so, the First Mage withdrew from the world, sealing its power away and leaving humanity to its own devices. But even now, as the ages pass and new civilizations rise and fall, whispers of the First Mage and its incredible power still echo throughout the land.
