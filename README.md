# Arathia Project

*The Arathia Project is the creation of a fictional world named Arathia and some stories & games to go along with it.*

> **Disclaimer**: As of right now, the setting and lore of Arathia is largely written by GPT 3.5 which seems to have written it to be very anime-inspired. This might change in the future, though, as nothing is final.
