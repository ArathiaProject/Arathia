# World Description

In the world of Arathia, magic is an integral part of everyday life. It flows through the land and imbues all living creatures with unique abilities and potential. However, not everyone can wield magic, and those who can are categorized and treated specially based on their abilities. Social status and standing are determined based on the amount and type of magic a person can wield.

At the lowest tier of magic are the Mundanes, those who have no magical ability whatsoever. They make up the majority of the population in Arathia, and while they can't use magic, they are still an important part of society. They usually work in manual labor jobs, such as farming or construction, or in service jobs, such as waitressing or cleaning.

Elementalists are the most common type of magic user in Arathia. They have the ability to manipulate small amounts of Arathia's magical energy to control the elements of earth, water, fire, and air. Some Elementalists can only control one element, while others can control multiple. The strength of their abilities also varies, with some Elementalists able to create small sparks of fire, while others can summon massive firestorms.

Elementalists have trouble controlling anything past a sliver of the land's magical energy, and usually mostly use their own energy instead. The use of one's own magical energy is dangerous, however, as using too much can cause permanent damage to the user's physical and mental states.

In Arathia, Elementalists often work in jobs that require their abilities. For example, they might work as farmers, using their powers to make crops grow faster and yield more. They might also work in construction, using earth magic to move heavy objects or shape buildings. In times of war, some Elementalists are highly valued for their ability to create devastating attacks or powerful defenses.

Illusionists are another type of magic user in Arathia. They were created as a result of human experiments and have the ability to create realistic illusions that can fool even the most astute observer. Illusionists can create images, sounds, and even smells that seem real, even though they are not. They can use their abilities for entertainment, such as creating elaborate shows for audiences, or for more nefarious purposes, such as deceiving enemies or stealing information.

In Arathia, Illusionists are often employed as spies, using their abilities to gather information without being detected. They might also work as entertainers, creating shows that dazzle audiences and leave them wondering how they did it. However, the use of illusion magic is tightly regulated, and Illusionists must be careful not to break the law.

Enchanters are magic users who specialize in imbuing objects with magical energy and properties. They can create magical items that can do everything from healing wounds to granting the user temporary invincibility, depending on the strength of the caster. Enchanters can also imbue weapons with magical properties, such as increasing their sharpness or imbuing them with the power of the elements.

Enchanters are highly sought after in Arathia, as their creations are incredibly valuable. They might work for wealthy patrons, creating magical items for them to use, or they might run their own shops, selling their creations to the general public.

At the top rank of Enchanters are the Artificers. Artificers are Enchanters who can create truly awe-inspiring magical creations. They might create sentient golems to do their bidding, or imbue entire cities with magical protection. Artificers are rare, and their creations are highly prized.

Necromancers are a controversial group of magic users in Arathia. Their power is a refined form of enchanting with the ability to control the dead, raising corpses to do the user's bidding. The most powerful Necromancers can use their abilities to create undead armies, which they can use to even conquer entire kingdoms.

Because of the danger they pose, Necromancers are highly feared and often persecuted. Many Necromancers are forced to live in hiding, practicing their dark arts in secret. However, there are some who use their abilities for good, such as using their powers to communicate with the dead or to provide closure to those who have lost loved ones.

At the top rank of Necromancers are the Deathlords. Deathlords are Necromancers who have mastered their abilities to an incredible degree. They can control entire armies of undead with ease, and their powers over death and decay are unparalleled. Deathlords are incredibly dangerous, and their mere presence can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors.

At the highest tier of magic are the Mages. Mages have access to magical energy in its purest form, allowing them to control all types of magic and use them to varying degrees of strength. They are the most powerful magic users in Arathia and are highly respected for their abilities. Mages are often advisors to kings and queens, helping them make decisions that affect the entire kingdom. They might also lead powerful magical organizations, such as the Mage's Guild, which is responsible for regulating the use of magic in Arathia.

Within the Mages, there are three ranks: the Acolytes, the Sorcerers, and the Archmages.

Acolytes are magic users who are just beginning to learn the basics of magic. They are often young or new to the craft, and they are still developing their skills. Acolytes might spend their days studying ancient tomes or practicing basic spells.

Sorcerers are the next level up from Acolytes. They are skilled magic users who are able to wield powerful spells. Sorcerers might be hired by powerful nobles or kingdoms to help them in their battles, and they might be feared by their enemies for their incredible abilities.

At the top of the Mage tier are the Archmages. Archmages are the most powerful magic users in Arathia, and they are incredibly rare. They are able to cast spells that can level entire cities or summon massive creatures to do their bidding. Archmages might be revered by some as gods, and they might be hunted by others as dangerous criminals. They are highly respected and often wield great influence in Arathian society.

In Arathia, there are legends about a special kind of Archmage called Ascendants. These magic users are said to have been granted some of the First Mage's power, and are able to manipulate reality and life themselves.

However, the use of magic in Arathia is tightly regulated, and breaking the laws surrounding magic can result in severe consequences. Magic users must be careful not to use their abilities for personal gain or to harm others.

Despite these restrictions, there are still those who seek to use magic for their own gain. Some magic users might use their abilities to gain power or wealth, while others might use them to harm others. This leads to a constant struggle between those who use magic for good and those who use it for evil.

In Arathia, magic is an integral part of everyday life. It shapes the society and the people who live there. It is a powerful tool, but also a dangerous one, and those who wield it must be careful not to let it consume them.
