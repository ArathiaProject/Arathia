# World Description

In the world of Arathia, magic is an integral part of everyday life. It flows through the land and imbues all living creatures with unique abilities and potential. However, not everyone can wield magic, and those who can are categorized based on their abilities.

At the lowest tier of magic are the Mundanes, those who have no magical ability whatsoever. They make up the majority of the population in Arathia, and while they can't use magic, they are still an important part of society. They usually work in manual labor jobs, such as farming or construction, or in service jobs, such as waitressing or cleaning.

Elementalists are the most common type of magic user in Arathia. They can control the elements of earth, water, fire, and air to varying degrees. Some Elementalists can only control one element, while others can control multiple. The strength of their abilities also varies, with some Elementalists able to create small sparks of fire, while others can summon massive firestorms.

In Arathia, Elementalists often work in jobs that require their abilities. For example, they might work as farmers, using their powers to make crops grow faster and yield more. They might also work in construction, using earth magic to move heavy objects or shape buildings. In times of war, Elementalists are highly valued for their ability to create devastating attacks or powerful defenses.

Illusionists are another type of magic user in Arathia. They have the ability to create realistic illusions that can fool even the most astute observer. Illusionists can create images, sounds, and even smells that seem real, even though they are not. They can use their abilities for entertainment, such as creating elaborate shows for audiences, or for more nefarious purposes, such as deceiving enemies or stealing information.

In Arathia, Illusionists are often employed as spies, using their abilities to gather information without being detected. They might also work as entertainers, creating shows that dazzle audiences and leave them wondering how they did it. However, the use of illusion magic is tightly regulated, and Illusionists must be careful not to break the law.

Enchanters are magic users who specialize in imbuing objects with magical properties. They can create magical items that can do everything from healing wounds to granting the user temporary invincibility. Enchanters can also imbue weapons with magical properties, such as increasing their sharpness or imbuing them with the power of the elements.

Enchanters are highly sought after in Arathia, as their creations are incredibly valuable. They might work for wealthy patrons, creating magical items for them to use, or they might run their own shops, selling their creations to the general public.

At the top tier of Enchanters are the Artificers. Artificers are Enchanters who can create truly awe-inspiring magical creations. They might create sentient golems to do their bidding, or imbue entire cities with magical protection. Artificers are rare, and their creations are highly prized.

Necromancers are a controversial group of magic users in Arathia. They have the ability to control the dead, raising corpses to do their bidding. Necromancers can use their abilities to create undead armies, which they can use to conquer entire kingdoms.

Because of the danger they pose, Necromancers are highly feared and often persecuted. Many Necromancers are forced to live in hiding, practicing their dark arts in secret. However, there are some who use their abilities for good, such as using their powers to communicate with the dead or to provide closure to those who have lost loved ones.

At the top tier of Necromancers are the Deathlords. Deathlords are Necromancers who have mastered their abilities to an incredible degree. They can control entire armies of undead with ease, and their powers over death and decay are unparalleled. Deathlords are incredibly dangerous, and their mere presence can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors.

At the top tier of magic are the Mages. Mages have access to all types of magic and can use them to varying degrees of strength. They are the most powerful magic users in Arathia and are highly respected for their abilities. Mages are often advisors to kings and queens, helping them make decisions that affect the entire kingdom. They might also lead powerful magical organizations, such as the Mage's Guild, which is responsible for regulating the use of magic in Arathia.

Within the Mages, there are four subtiers of magic users: the Acolytes, the Magi, the Sorcerers, and the Archmages.

Acolytes are magic users who are just beginning to learn the basics of magic. They are often young or new to the craft, and they are still developing their skills. Acolytes might spend their days studying ancient tomes or practicing basic spells.

The next level up is the Magi. Magi have a better grasp of magic than Acolytes, and they are able to cast more complex spells. Magi might specialize in a particular element or type of magic, such as fire magic or healing magic. They might also begin to experiment with combining different types of magic to create new effects.

Sorcerers are the next level up from Magi. They are highly skilled magic users who are able to wield incredibly powerful spells. Sorcerers might be hired by powerful nobles or kingdoms to help them in their battles, and they might be feared by their enemies for their incredible abilities.

At the top of the Mage tier are the Archmages. Archmages are the most powerful magic users in Arathia, and they are incredibly rare. They are able to cast spells that can level entire cities or summon massive creatures to do their bidding. Archmages might be revered by some as gods, and they might be hunted by others as dangerous criminals. They are highly respected and often wield great influence in Arathian society.

In Arathia, there are legends about a special kind of Archmage called Ascendants. These magic users are said to be able to manipulate reality and life themselves, and their abilities are truly limitless.

However, the use of magic in Arathia is tightly regulated, and breaking the laws surrounding magic can result in severe consequences. Magic users must be careful not to use their abilities for personal gain or to harm others. They must also be careful not to reveal their abilities to Mundanes, as the use of magic is highly feared and misunderstood by those who lack it.

Despite these restrictions, there are still those who seek to use magic for their own gain. Some magic users might use their abilities to gain power or wealth, while others might use them to harm others. This leads to a constant struggle between those who use magic for good and those who use it for evil.

In Arathia, magic is an integral part of everyday life. It shapes the society and the people who live there. It is a powerful tool, but also a dangerous one, and those who wield it must be careful not to let it consume them.
